For this assignment, I wanted to address the newsy topic of abortion legislation heading into tomorrow's Supreme Court case. 

I used information from two sets of data from the Guttmacher institute ([here](https://www.guttmacher.org/state-policy/explore/overview-abortion-laws) and [here](https://www.guttmacher.org/state-policy/explore/state-policies-later-abortions#)) and created my own spreadsheet with the earliest currently-law abortion ban in the state. I assigned a value to each level of abortion bans and created the map gradient with those values.
