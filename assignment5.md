I have a few versions of this draft -- I started out with the idea of 3 separate groups of line graphs, but the site I used to make it **pretty** wouldn't let me toggle with the y-axis enough to make the difference stark (cons of trying to make the graph pretty without any tech savvy).

My first two versions, draft form:
1. https://github.com/juliamuellerthewriter/datavisualization-fall2021/blob/main/design%201.png
2. https://github.com/juliamuellerthewriter/datavisualization-fall2021/blob/main/design%202.png

Then I switched to a line graph form:

2. https://github.com/juliamuellerthewriter/datavisualization-fall2021/blob/main/design%203.png

I settled on this as the final version, but am still not really satisfied with the way it turned out -- all along, I wanted to incorporate the maps as a kind of key for helping identify the graphs, but it didn't really end up welding the aesthetic and the readability of the graph well.
