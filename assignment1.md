# Class Final Project Pitch

Interesting Question(s, _potentially_) | Available Data (_potentially_) | Timeliness | Sources (_potentially_) | Etc.
------------------- | -------------- | ---------- | -------- 
Are college-age voting rates at all related to students' majors? Can trends in college-age voter turnout be correllated to trends in students' majors (perhaps using a specific school or a small group of area schools as a case study?) Conversely, are students gravitating towards certain majors as the national trend of college-age voter turnout goes up? | NSLVE data, individual colleges' matriculation/grad reports | College-age voter turnout has been increasing: it doubled in 2018 from the 2016 election rates and surged in 2020. College-age voters are becoming an increasingly vital demographic in local and national elections. Many studies have already attempted to examine factors in these increases, including self-reported motivators like the pandemic and recent unrest. Though this data story would not be able to examine or control for the broad swath of factors/motivators in voter turnout, it may be able to determine whether there exists any potential relationship between voter turnout and major/field of study. | School admin/representatives, individual students or heads of student orgs, political analysts, poll runners, professors | It looks like a similar study was conducted by a Tufts researcher in 2016, when voter turnout was low--an INside Higher Ed feature on the research examined the low college-age voter turnout re: major. Though similar work has been done, it may be interesting to examine how trends in major choice have changed since this report. 

# Data-Driven Investigation Critique

### Clarity and accuracy

* Were you able to immediately identify the central insight the reporter was trying to communicate? Answer on a 1-5 scale, with 5 being excellent and 1 being below expectations. __4__
   * What was it? __The central insight was information about the allocation of federal aid to small businesses, and showed the divisions of funds across both geographical areas and industries.__
   * Was it in the headline? __The headline revealed that it was an investigation into the allocation of the $521 billion US small-business aid, but didn't reveal further insights about where most of the money had gone/where money hadn't reached. The final paragraph added a note that the first round of lending did not reach areas most impacted by the pandemic.__
* If there was a data visualization, were you able to understand how to read it? Again, use a 5-point scale with 5 = excellent __5__
   * Was that the most efficient way to navigate the visualization? __Hovering over the map, reading the chart__
   * Can you suggest ways to improve navigation? __The highlighted yellow bars in the industry chart are not necessarily clear in their meaning/relation to other bars in the same chart.__
* Using your own knowledge and critical thinking abilities, do you think the data was accurate? 1-5, with 5 most accurate __4__
   * List any areas where you question the accuracy of the data. __The conclusions referenced at the end of the article, about a group of researchers who found 
   * List sources you would suggest the reporter check with. 
   * Did they provide a source? __Yes__
   * Did they explain everything that needed explaining? __I think an interesting element of the article itself is the information in the middle about how the program has not worked for all businesses, how some businesses are not applying, and how $132 billion remained unspent even though Congress extended the program. This information isn't showcased by the data presented in the map and chart.__

### Quality

* Regardless of the form that the graphic/story takes, was it executed at a high degree of quality? (Rank 1-5, with five excellent.) __5__
   * Explain what they did well and areas where improvements could be made. __The graphics are simple, but play well with the text of the article, are aesthetically cohesive, and are easy to navigate. I think the article itself could be augmented through more explanation--or more graphics for the additional pieces of information it introduces--but the story as a whole is generally effective.__

### Type and color (if piece includes graphics)

* Based on your knowledge of color and type use, did this person use type (as in typography, fonts) and color to their best purpose? __Yes, the story was aesthetically cohesive. The eye was drawn to the map--and the breakdown of the colors on the map was easy to understand. Green may have been more appropriate than yellow for a story about money?__ 
   * For example, did it: 
       * Look like it all belonged together?
       * Draw your eye first to the most important pieces of information?
       * Make sense? For example, if it discussed heat, did it use the color red to communicate the degree of heat rather than, say, blue?
* Type (1-5) __5__
   * Explain __The sans-serif font was readable and clear, and the black color contrasted well against the yellow map.__
* Color (1-5) __4__
   * Explain __The consistency of the yellow color across both the map and the chart was aesthetically pleasing, although the only-lightly varied colors of the map does not necessarily lend itself to readability/accessibility at different brightness levels.__
   
### Creativity

* Did the piece use some creative elements to good effect? As in, to emphasize those areas that could draw someone in, or to add detail where needed, but not just random visual or story junk that distracts you? How? __The graphic was effective, but not necessarily creative. The map was interactive in the sense that hovering over certain areas revealed new information about a state at large, but didn't share information about the highlighted counties within each state map. There could have been more of an interactive element with the industry chart, too, with further breakdown or information about the relationship between different data pieces.__
   * Rate effectiveness on scale of 1-5. __3__
