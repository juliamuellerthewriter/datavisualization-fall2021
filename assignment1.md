# Class Final Project Pitch

Interesting Question(s, _potentially_) | Available Data (_potentially_) | Timeliness | Sources (_potentially_) | Etc.
------------------- | -------------- | ---------- | -------- 
Are college-age voting rates at all related to students' majors? Can trends in college-age voter turnout be correllated to trends in students' majors (perhaps using a specific school or a small group of area schools as a case study?) Conversely, are students gravitating towards certain majors as the national trend of college-age voter turnout goes up? | NSLVE data, individual colleges' matriculation/grad reports | College-age voter turnout has been increasing: it doubled in 2018 from the 2016 election rates and surged in 2020. College-age voters are becoming an increasingly vital demographic in local and national elections. Many studies have already attempted to examine factors in these increases, including self-reported motivators like the pandemic and recent unrest. Though this data story would not be able to examine or control for the broad swath of factors/motivators in voter turnout, it may be able to determine whether there exists any potential relationship between voter turnout and major/field of study. | School admin/representatives, individual students or heads of student orgs, political analysts, poll runners, professors | It looks like a similar study was conducted by a Tufts researcher in 2016, when voter turnout was low--an INside Higher Ed feature on the research examined the low college-age voter turnout re: major. Though similar work has been done, it may be interesting to examine how trends in major choice have changed since this report. 

# Data-Driven Investigation Critique

### Clarity and accuracy

* Were you able to immediately identify the central insight the reporter was trying to communicate? Answer on a 1-5 scale, with 5 being excellent and 1 being below expectations. 
   * What was it?
   * Was it in the headline?
* If there was a data visualization, were you able to understand how to read it? Again, use a 5-point scale with 5 = excellent
   * Was that the most efficient way to navigate the visualization? 
   * Can you suggest ways to improve navigation?
* Using your own knowledge and critical thinking abilities, do you think the data was accurate? 1-5, with 5 most accurate
   * List any areas where you question the accuracy of the data.
   * List sources you would suggest the reporter check with. 
   * Did they provide a source?
   * Did they explain everything that needed explaining?

### Quality

* Regardless of the form that the graphic/story takes, was it executed at a high degree of quality? (Rank 1-5, with five excellent.)
   * Explain what they did well and areas where improvements could be made. 

### Type and color (if piece includes graphics)

* Based on your knowledge of color and type use, did this person use type (as in typography, fonts) and color to their best purpose?
   * For example, did it: 
       * Look like it all belonged together?
       * Draw your eye first to the most important pieces of information?
       * Make sense? For example, if it discussed heat, did it use the color red to communicate the degree of heat rather than, say, blue?
* Type (1-5)
   * Explain
* Color (1-5)
   * Explain
   
### Creativity

* Did the piece use some creative elements to good effect? As in, to emphasize those areas that could draw someone in, or to add detail where needed, but not just random visual or story junk that distracts you?
   * How?
   * Rate effectiveness on scale of 1-5.
