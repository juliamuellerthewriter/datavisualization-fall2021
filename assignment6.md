I noticed that a lot of the examples from last week's assignment had grouped the data in this case by region, and I did something similar with my draft last week. This time, I wanted to try grouping the data into columns by year to put more emphasis on my "thesis" that Europe has consistently dominated the market. I made both versions, of course, but am uploading this one as my final because I think it highlights the stark difference between Europe and the other regions year over year.

I made a DataWrapper chart in that vein, and the interactive version [here](https://datawrapper.dwcdn.net/m84LI/1/) shows exact values when hovered.
